<p>Connecting to your why, will help you to think more clearly, empower your relationships, broaden your windows of opportunity and most importantly it will fuel your energy and ambition. Your why is the reason you wake up every morning and do what you do day after day. When you truly connect to your inner why, you will never be the same again. Connecting to your why can sometimes happen through a process called journaling. Journaling is a type of writing where you just start writing all of your thoughts out on a paper at night before you go to bed. It continues on until your mind starts to see certain patterns and begins to have some clarity on what really matters most to you and what brings you down and further from yourself. Connecting to your why can also happen through inspiration when meditating. Some people connect to their why, via a life coach, who has professional techniques and processes designed to connect your to your life purpose or why.</p>
