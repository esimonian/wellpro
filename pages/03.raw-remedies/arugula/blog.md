Arugula, also known as Rocket, is one of my all-time favorite raw leafy green detox remedies! I love Arugula’s peppery and woodsy flavor in salads and also atop my favorite grain-free mushroom pizza. The sharp and pungent flavor indicate its high mineral content of manganese, calcium, magnesium, potassium, copper, iron, and zinc. I love all cruciferous vegetables, and like all cruciferous vegetables’ arugula contains anti-cancer compounds called glucosinolates, which stimulate natural detoxifying enzymes in the body. It is also full of other detoxifying phytochemicals such as chlorophyll which helps the liver to detoxify the blood. It also contains plenty of carotene, which helps to scavenge free radicals (cancer causing substances) from the body. I recommend adding two tablespoons of fresh arugula to your salads, or on a detox, add 2 tablespoons to your fresh detox drink.
